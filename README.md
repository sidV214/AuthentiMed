AuthentiMed 🛡️💊
AuthentiMed is a dual-layered security ecosystem designed to eradicate counterfeit medications from the global supply chain. By integrating Deep Learning Computer Vision with Immutable Blockchain Ledgers, we provide a "mathematical certainty" of authenticity from the factory floor to the patient's hand.

🚀 The Problem
Human Cost: Counterfeit drugs contribute to over 1 million deaths annually.

Economic Impact: The pharmaceutical industry loses over $200 billion per year to illicit trade.

Technical Gaps: Existing QR codes are easily cloned, and centralized databases remain a "single point of failure".

💡 Our Solution: The "Dual-Shield"
We implement a two-factor verification process:

AI Physical Fingerprinting: Analyzes microscopic packaging anomalies and OCR labels that are impossible to replicate manually.

Blockchain Digital Twin: Records every transaction on a decentralized ledger, ensuring the digital record matches the physical product.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Mobile: React Native (Cross-platform Android/iOS application).

AI/ML: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch (CNN models for image analysis).

Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat (Smart Contracts), Ethers.js (Web3 Bridge for React Native).

Storage: IPFS (Decentralized metadata/image storage).

🗺️ Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP Foundations
Training the AI model for high-fidelity packaging recognition and OCR label validation.

Deployment of core Smart Contracts on Testnet with initial schema design.

Utilizing 6-hour agile sprint cycles to refine UI/UX and data flow integrity.

Phase 2: Pilot & Integration (6–12 Months)
Bridging AI scoring with Blockchain via Ethers.js for real-time verification.

Live testing with supply chain partners to simulate "Factory-to-Consumer" flows.

Launching a "Red Flag" dashboard for regulatory bodies like the FDA or NCB.

Phase 3: Global Scale (18+ Months)
Onboarding major manufacturers to the Mainnet.

Launching an API marketplace to allow 3rd-party logistics (3PL) integration.

🔮 Future Scope
IoT Smart Logistics: Integration of real-time temperature and humidity sensors for cold-chain monitoring.

Digital Health Passport: Providing patients with globally verified, tamper-proof medication records.

Predictive Defense: Using AI to forecast and identify counterfeit "hotspots" before products reach the market.
